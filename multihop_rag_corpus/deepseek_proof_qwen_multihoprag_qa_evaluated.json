The initial report from CBSSports.com noted that Purdy had performed exceptionally well against tough pass rushes and man coverage, completing all his throws on target. However, the subsequent analysis on October 12, 2023, while still positive, acknowledged that Purdy's performance tends to decline under pressure, with a lower completion rate and reduced yards per attempt in such situations. Despite this, the report still recommended starting Purdy over other quarterbacks like Trevor Lawrence, Geno Smith, and Jared Goff.",
